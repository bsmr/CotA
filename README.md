CotA is a small application to display the stats ("/stats") recorded to a chat log file from Shroud of the Avatar. 

To build CotA, you will need to install Qt5. Simply open CotA.pro in Qt Creator, select the project configuration (if it's the first time opening the project) and click build.

The first time you run CotA, you will need to select the SotA chat log folder from the file menu.
