CotA is a small application to display the stats ("/stats") recorded to a chat log file from Shroud of the Avatar. 

You will need to install Qt5, which is totally free. Download it from https://www.qt.io/. To build CotA, Simply open CotA.pro in Qt Creator, select the project configuration (if it's the first time opening the project) and click build (or run).

The first time you run CotA, you will need to select the SotA chat log folder from the file menu. On Linux, this is located under your home folder at ".config/Portalarium/Shroud of the Avatar/ChatLogs".
